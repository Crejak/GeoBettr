# GeoBettr

A lightweight browser extension for GeoGuessr.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project I do for fun, to add features I would like to 
GeoGuessr and learn how to create web browser extensions. I do not intend
to publish it. There is no guarantee that I will keep the project
up-to-date.

## User policy / "License"

You are totally free to use the extension as you want and modify it. You
can re-use the code for you own project, as long as you do not sell it.
You do not need to credit me (it would be appreciated if you do though).

## Features I want to add

- An integrated notepad that displays on top of the street view
  - Take notes without switching window or tab
  - See your notes at all times
  - Adjust the transparency so that it doesn't hide the game
- Score history tracker
  - Stored in a file (maybe in a remote storage later)
  - See your score history (best score for a specific format, best time 
  on a map, etc.)
- Add a clock for unlimited games (round time + global time)
